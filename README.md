# VN-tools

This is where I plan to make my own tools to make playing vn easier.

## Goal
[*] Add Japanese path support
[] Add custom parameter for better usage
[] Seperate the list with folder i.e. make it so that you can put the shortcut into different folder and organize them better.
[] Add GUI for ease of use

Other Tools are coming soon. ETA Forever.

# New Update
I have just made a python version of the program so that it is easier to read and manage in the future.


# Guide

1. Download the VNSelLE.py and pylnk3.py and put them in the same folder folder. This folder can be anywhere but I put them together with the shortcut for simplicity.
2. Make a shortcut of each of your VN and put them in the same folder. 
3. Now open the VNSelLE.py and change the value of "folder", "LE" and "tractor" to your own path.
  3.1 folder : where you keep all the shortcut file of the VN.
  3.2 LE     : where you put your Locale Emulator.
  3.3 tractor: where you put your Textractor.(x86)
5. (Optional): Use the NewVNSel.bat if you cannot double click to run the VNSelLE.py or what a quick way to run the script from the desktop. Make sure to change the path to match where you put the VNSelLE.py.  
 Enjoy!

## vnSelectorLE (Deprecated and Legacy version)
This is used along with Locale Emulator. This BAT script is use to make launching VN a little easier by having a list of vn along with using the Locale Emulator for you without right clicking it everytime.
NOTE: To make this work. You need to make a shortcut to the VN .exe file into one folder. Then you either place the vnSelectorLE inside it or change the directory that the BAT file points to.
