# VN-tools

This is where I plan to make my own tools to make playing vn easier.

# vnSelectorLE
This is used along with Locale Emulator. This BAT script is use to make launching VN a little easier by having a list of vn along with using the Locale Emulator for you without right clicking it everytime.
NOTE: To make this work. You need to make a shortcut to the VN .exe file into one folder. Then you either place the vnSelectorLE inside it or change the directory that the BAT file points to.

Other Tools are coming soon. ETA Forever.
